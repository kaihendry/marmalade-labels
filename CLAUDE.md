Please use [latex](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/TeX_Live) to design an A4 set of Marmalade labels.

We have a Brother DCP-L2530DW series printer.

We want to create labels three columns wide on A4 that says:

Praze Farm Marmalade

We plan to cut them out and stick onto the glass jars with milk.
